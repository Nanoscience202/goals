# [Goals](https://nanoscience202.github.io/goals/)
A simple website to make and set goals. It's the first website I made and meant to be used by me. <br />
Made when I was learning vanilla js, basic html and css and .json files. <br />
For a better looking and cooler goal making website I made, see [goals-remastered](https://github.com/Nanoscience202/goals-remastered).
